# KotlinRender
Simple Kotlin Render
It use swing to create window, and to draw inside it, here is also included a obj file reader, with simple meshes and in low res, it even works fast

because of rendering using swing polygons(in my case, triangles), you can make them wire, or solid

Some performance notes: i added backface culling, this means that only triangles in clockwise order will render, in other words:

in this triangle i render only 6 triangles, instead of 12, because only 6 are in clockwise, for me it means that only geomtry faced to me will render

in this image i entered a little bit inside th cube, as you can see, nothing renders, because everything inside is counter-clockwise.  
For player this mean that only geometry that he can see will be rendered

to render such wire, i loaded model twice in 2 diferent meshes, second mesh is rendered in wire mode, first normaly
you can use full software rendering, or turn on opengl. OpenGL accelerates only drawing process, not matrix operations, they are still made on cpu
